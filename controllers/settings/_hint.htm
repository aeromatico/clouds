            <strong>Progressive Web App (PWA)</strong> allows users to install your website
            as if it were a native application on their devices.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Icons are automatically generated if not provided</li>
            <li>The manifest is automatically updated with changes</li>
            <li>The Service Worker handles cache and offline functionality</li>
            <li>The install prompt appears automatically on compatible devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> PWA changes may take a few minutes to reflect
            in browsers due to caching.
